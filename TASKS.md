## Notes & Considerations

1. **AI Costs**: Monitor token usage carefully; implement caching and prompt optimization
2. **Platform API Limits**: Each platform has different rate limits; implement proper throttling
3. **Content Quality**: Start with conservative prompts; gather user feedback to improve
4. **Privacy**: Never store repository code; only metadata and activity summaries
5. **Scalability**: Design for multi-tenancy from day one
6. **Compliance**: Ensure all platform integrations follow their Terms of Service
7. **User Control**: Always give users final approval; AI is assistant, not replacement
