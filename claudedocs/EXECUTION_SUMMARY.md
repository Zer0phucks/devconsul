## ðŸš¦ Daily Coordination

### Morning Standup (15 minutes)
Each agent reports:
1. Yesterday's completed tasks
2. Today's planned tasks
3. Blockers or dependencies
4. Integration needs

### Evening Sync (10 minutes)
1. Review completed work
2. Preview tomorrow's tasks
3. Coordinate integration points
4. Update task board

### Weekly Integration (2 hours)
1. Full system integration test
2. Code review for all PRs
3. Update documentation
4. Plan next week

## ðŸ”„ Integration Workflow

### Feature Branch Strategy
```
main
â”œâ”€â”€ feat/phase-1-agent-a (social-platforms)
â”œâ”€â”€ feat/phase-1-agent-b (blog-platforms)
â”œâ”€â”€ feat/phase-1-agent-c (auth-security)
â”œâ”€â”€ feat/phase-1-agent-d (code-quality)
â””â”€â”€ feat/phase-1-agent-e (ai-generation)
```

### Merge Protocol

## ðŸš¨ Risk Management

### Top 5 Risks

**1. Platform API Complexity** (High Impact, Medium Likelihood)
- **Mitigation**: Start with easiest platforms, build reusable patterns
- **Contingency**: Have fallback platforms ready

**2. Integration Conflicts** (Medium Impact, High Likelihood)
- **Mitigation**: Daily integration, micro-PRs, feature flags
- **Contingency**: Integration lead resolves conflicts daily

**3. Security Vulnerabilities** (High Impact, Low Likelihood)
- **Mitigation**: Continuous security review, automated scanning
- **Contingency**: Security expert on-call for critical issues

**4. Performance Degradation** (Medium Impact, Medium Likelihood)
- **Mitigation**: Benchmark early, optimize incrementally
- **Contingency**: Performance budget alerts, rollback capability

**5. Timeline Slippage** (Medium Impact, Medium Likelihood)
- **Mitigation**: 20% time buffer, prioritize ruthlessly
- **Contingency**: Cut scope to Phase 1 + critical Phase 2 items
