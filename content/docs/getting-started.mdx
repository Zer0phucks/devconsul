# Getting Started with Full Self Publishing

Welcome to Full Self Publishing! This guide will walk you through setting up your account and generating your first piece of automated content.

## What is Full Self Publishing?

Full Self Publishing is an automated content generation platform that monitors your GitHub repository activity and uses AI to create platform-specific content. Turn your commits, pull requests, and releases into blog posts, social media updates, and newsletters automatically.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- A GitHub account with at least one repository
- Access to at least one publishing platform (WordPress, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)
- An active email address for account verification

## Step 1: Create Your Account

1. Visit [fullselfpublishing.com](https://fullselfpublishing.com)
2. Click "Sign Up" in the top right corner
3. Choose your sign-up method:
   - Email and password
   - Sign in with Google
   - Sign in with GitHub
4. Verify your email address (if using email/password)
5. Complete your profile information

**Time estimate:** 2-3 minutes

## Step 2: Connect Your GitHub Repository {#github}

### Why GitHub?

We need access to your repository to read:
- Commit messages and descriptions
- Pull request details
- Release notes and changelogs
- Issue updates

We **never** modify your code or access repository contents beyond metadata.

### Connection Steps

1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > GitHub**
2. Click **"Connect GitHub Account"**
3. Authorize Full Self Publishing in the GitHub OAuth flow
4. Select which repositories to connect (you can add more later)
5. Choose your primary repository for content generation

**Permissions we request:**
- `repo:read` - Read repository metadata
- `user:email` - Identify your account

### Troubleshooting

**Issue:** "Repository not showing up"
- **Solution:** Make sure you've granted access to the repository in your GitHub settings

**Issue:** "OAuth connection failed"
- **Solution:** Check that you're logged into the correct GitHub account

## Step 3: Create Your First Project

Projects help you organize content generation for different repositories or purposes.

1. Go to **Dashboard**
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Fill in the project details:
   - **Name:** Your project name (e.g., "My Awesome Library")
   - **Repository:** Select the connected GitHub repo
   - **Description:** Brief project description (helps AI understand context)
4. Click **"Create Project"**

**Pro tip:** Create separate projects for different repositories or different content strategies for the same repo.

## Step 4: Configure Content Settings

### Choose Content Types

Decide what types of content you want to generate:

- **Blog Posts** - Long-form articles about updates and features
- **Social Media** - Short updates for Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.
- **Newsletters** - Email summaries of recent activity
- **Release Notes** - Formatted changelog announcements

Enable the types you want in **Project Settings > Content Types**.

### Set Your Brand Voice

Tell the AI how to write in your style:

1. Go to **Project Settings > Brand Voice**
2. Choose your tone:
   - **Professional** - Formal, business-focused
   - **Casual** - Friendly, conversational
   - **Technical** - Developer-focused, detailed
3. Add custom instructions (optional):
   ```
   Example: "Write in an enthusiastic tone, use emojis sparingly,
   focus on developer benefits, and always include code examples."
   ```

### Configure Generation Schedule

Set how often content should be generated:

1. Go to **Project Settings > Schedule**
2. Choose frequency:
   - **Daily** - Check for activity every day
   - **Weekly** - Monday morning reviews
   - **Monthly** - First of the month summaries
   - **On-Demand** - Manual triggers only
3. Set timezone for scheduling

**Recommendation:** Start with weekly to see how it works, then adjust.
