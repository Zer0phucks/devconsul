# WordPress Integration

Automatically publish blog posts to your WordPress site using Full Self Publishing.

## Prerequisites

- WordPress site (self-hosted or WordPress.com)
- Admin access to your WordPress site
- WordPress Application Passwords enabled (WordPress 5.6+)

## Setup Methods

### Method 1: OAuth (Recommended for WordPress.com)

**Best for:** WordPress.com sites, managed WordPress hosts with OAuth support

1. Go to **Settings > Platforms > WordPress**
2. Click **"Connect with OAuth"**
3. Select your WordPress.com site or enter custom OAuth endpoint
4. Click **"Authorize"**
5. You'll be redirected to WordPress to grant permissions
6. Click **"Approve"** to allow Full Self Publishing access
7. You'll be redirected back with "Connected" status

**Permissions granted:**
- Create and publish posts
- Upload media (featured images)
- Manage categories and tags

### Method 2: Application Passwords (Self-Hosted)

**Best for:** Self-hosted WordPress installations

#### Step 1: Enable Application Passwords

WordPress 5.6+ has Application Passwords built-in. If you don't see this feature:

1. Install the **Application Passwords** plugin
2. Activate the plugin
3. Go to **Users > Your Profile**

#### Step 2: Generate Application Password

1. Scroll to **Application Passwords** section
2. Enter application name: `Full Self Publishing`
3. Click **"Add New Application Password"**
4. **Copy the generated password immediately** (you won't see it again)

The password looks like: `xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx`

#### Step 3: Configure Full Self Publishing

1. Go to **Settings > Platforms > WordPress**
2. Select **"Application Password"** method
3. Enter your credentials:
   - **Site URL:** `https://yourdomain.com` (no trailing slash)
   - **Username:** Your WordPress username
   - **Application Password:** Paste the password (spaces are okay)
4. Click **"Connect"**
5. Wait for connection verification

## Configuration Options

### Post Settings

Configure how posts are created:

- **Status:** Draft, Pending Review, or Publish
- **Author:** Select WordPress user to attribute posts to
- **Category:** Default category for generated posts
- **Tags:** Automatically add tags based on content
- **Comment Status:** Open or Closed
- **Ping Status:** Open or Closed

### Featured Images

**Enable AI-generated featured images:**
1. Toggle **"Generate Featured Images"** in platform settings
2. Choose image style (professional, creative, technical)
3. Images are uploaded to your WordPress media library
4. Alternative: Disable auto-generation and add manually

### Custom Fields

Map Full Self Publishing data to WordPress custom fields:

```
GitHub Commit SHA → custom_field: source_commit
Generation Date → custom_field: ai_generated_date
Platform → custom_field: published_from
```

## Publishing Workflow

### Default Post Structure

Generated WordPress posts include:

```html
<!-- Title -->
h1: Derived from GitHub activity summary

<!-- Content -->
Introduction paragraph
Main content with headings (H2, H3)
Code blocks (if applicable)
Conclusion with call-to-action

<!-- Metadata -->
Categories: Auto-detected or default
Tags: AI-generated based on content
Excerpt: First 150 characters
```

### Pre-Publish Checklist

Before enabling auto-publish, verify:

- [ ] Connection status is "Connected"
- [ ] Post status is set appropriately (Draft recommended for testing)
- [ ] Default category exists
- [ ] Author user has correct permissions
- [ ] Featured image generation is configured (if enabled)
- [ ] Test a manual publish first

## Advanced Features

### Custom Templates

Override default post structure:

1. Go to **Project Settings > Templates**
2. Create new template for WordPress
3. Use placeholders:
   - `{{title}}` - Generated title
   - `{{content}}` - Main content
   - `{{summary}}` - Brief summary
   - `{{github_url}}` - Link to repository
   - `{{commit_sha}}` - Commit reference
4. Save and select as default

Example template:
```markdown
{{content}}

---

**This post was auto-generated from GitHub activity.**
[View source on GitHub]({{github_url}})
```

### Gutenberg Blocks

Generate content as Gutenberg blocks:

1. Enable **"Use Gutenberg Format"** in WordPress settings
2. Content will be structured as blocks:
   - Paragraph blocks
   - Heading blocks
   - Code blocks (for snippets)
   - Image blocks (for featured images)

### Classic Editor

For sites still using Classic Editor:

1. Content generated as HTML
2. `<p>`, `<h2>`, `<pre>` tags used
3. No block delimiters

### Scheduling

Publish posts at specific times:

1. Set **Post Status** to "Future"
2. Configure publish time in content settings
3. WordPress handles scheduled publishing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Connection failed"**
- Verify WordPress URL is correct (include https://)
- Check username and application password
- Ensure Application Passwords is enabled
- Try resetting the application password

**"Unauthorized" errors**
- Verify user has `publish_posts` capability
- Check application password hasn't expired
- Re-authenticate with WordPress

**"Cannot upload images"**
- Confirm user has `upload_files` capability
- Check WordPress media directory permissions
- Verify file size limits

**Posts not appearing**
- Check post status (might be Draft)
- Verify category exists
- Look in WordPress admin under All Posts

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

1. Go to **Settings > Advanced > Debug**
2. Toggle **"Enable WordPress Debug Logging"**
3. Logs show in **Settings > Activity Log**
4. Look for WordPress API responses

## API Endpoints Used

Full Self Publishing uses the WordPress REST API:

```
POST   /wp-json/wp/v2/posts          - Create posts
POST   /wp-json/wp/v2/media          - Upload images
GET    /wp-json/wp/v2/categories     - Fetch categories
GET    /wp-json/wp/v2/tags           - Fetch tags
GET    /wp-json/wp/v2/users/me       - Verify authentication
```

## Security Best Practices

- Use Application Passwords (never use main password)
- Revoke unused application passwords regularly
- Use HTTPS for your WordPress site
- Limit user capabilities to minimum required
- Review published content before going live
- Enable two-factor authentication on WordPress

## Rate Limits

WordPress REST API limits:
- WordPress.com: 100 requests/minute
- Self-hosted: Depends on server configuration
- Recommended: Max 10 posts per hour
